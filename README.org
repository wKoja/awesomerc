* Linux AwesomeWM Modular Starter Kit

This is a Modular Starter Kit for AwesomeWM, it aesthetically stays close to the
default AwesomeWM config, however there are a few sane functional defaults that
are added in and everything is completely refactored into their respective
modular files. This makes everything neat and hopefully more understandable for
beginners, or just giving more experienced users a quick base to jump off of.
